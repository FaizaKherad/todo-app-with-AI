$ARGUMENTS
```

# Response

```
Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Web Application & Database Persistence feature. The following artifacts have been created:

1. Implementation plan (plan.md) - Complete technical plan with context, constitution check, and project structure
2. Research summary (research.md) - Technical decisions and alternatives considered
3. Data model (data-model.md) - Complete entity definitions and database schema
4. API contracts (contracts/todo-api-contract.md) - Detailed API specification with request/response formats
5. Quickstart guide (quickstart.md) - Setup and usage instructions
6. Agent context updated - Added Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and NeonDB technologies to agent knowledge

All required planning phases have been completed according to the workflow:
- Phase 0: Research completed
- Phase 1: Data model, contracts, quickstart, and agent context completed
- Constitution check passed both pre and post design

The plan is ready for the next phase (/sp.tasks) to break the implementation into specific tasks.
